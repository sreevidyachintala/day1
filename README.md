In this program we need to initialize 3 values as n1,n2,n3.
Other wise we need to read or prompt values from user using input() method.
After Initiolizing or reading values, we have to compare n1 with n2 and n3. 
if n1 is bigger than n2 and n3 it prints n1 value
otherwise we have to compare n2 and n3. 
if n2 is bigger than n3 it prints n2 otherwise it prints n3.
